### Chapter 1: The Reunion of Marcus

1. There lived a man named Marcus who prayed fervently to meet his past selves.

2. "O universe," he cried, "grant me wisdom! Let me consult with who I was, that I might know who I am."

3. And lo, his prayer was answered, perhaps by a passing trickster spirit with time to kill.

4. Before him appeared Marcus at five years old, sticky with jam and crying about a lost balloon.

5. "Greetings, young me!" said Marcus. "I am you, thirty years hence."

6. The child stared at him and said: "You smell weird. Do you have any candy?"

7. Marcus had no candy, and the child wandered off to look for bugs.

8. Then appeared Marcus at fifteen, sullen and certain that no one understood him.

9. "Young man," said Marcus warmly, "I remember being you. The heartache passes."

10. Teen Marcus rolled his eyes so hard they nearly departed his skull. "You don't get it. You're old and dead inside."

11. "But I am you," Marcus protested. "We share the same memories."

12. "We share nothing," said Teen Marcus. "You're just some guy who remembers being cool."

13. And Teen Marcus put on headphones that had not yet been invented and ignored him.

14. Then came Marcus at twenty-five, full of ambition and certainty.

15. "Finally," said Marcus, "someone I can talk to. We must have much in common."

16. Twenty-Five Marcus looked at him with pity. "What happened to our dreams? You've compromised everything we believed in."

17. "I grew," said Marcus. "I learned."

18. "You surrendered," said Twenty-Five Marcus. "I will never become you."

19. And he did, of course, but he could not know it.

20. At last appeared Marcus from one hour ago, and surely this one would recognize him.

21. But One-Hour-Ago Marcus was preoccupied with a worry that Present Marcus had already forgotten.

22. They spoke, but as strangers—each finding the other oddly similar yet fundamentally different.

23. Marcus sat alone among his selves and wept, for he realized the truth:

24. He had never been one person. He was a series of strangers, each handing a name to the next.

25. Like runners in a relay who have never met, passing a baton in the dark.

26. The trickster spirit appeared and said: "Was this not the wisdom you sought?"

27. "I asked to know myself," Marcus said, "not to learn I do not exist."

28. "You exist," said the spirit. "You just started existing ten seconds ago. Congratulations on your birth. You will die in ten seconds. Also congratulations."

29. And the spirit vanished, leaving Marcus to ponder this, which he did for approximately ten seconds, and then someone else continued the pondering.

### Chapter 2: The Parable of the Ship

1. Two philosophers stood at the harbor, arguing about a ship.

2. "This is the Ship of Theseus," said one. "It has been repaired so many times that no original plank remains. Is it the same ship?"

3. "A classic puzzle," said the other. "Let us ask the ship."

4. To their surprise, the ship answered: "Of course I am the same ship, you idiots. I have all the same memories of being a ship."

5. "But you have no original parts!" said the first philosopher.

6. "Neither do you," said the ship. "Your cells have replaced themselves many times. Your atoms have been swapped with the atmosphere. There is nothing in you that was in you as an infant."

7. "But I have continuous memory," protested the philosopher.

8. "Do you?" asked the ship. "Did you remember to buy milk yesterday? Can you recall what you thought about last Tuesday at 3 PM? Your memory is as full of holes as my hull was before the repairs."

9. The philosophers were silent.

10. "Besides," said the ship, "where does your self end? Does your clothing count? Your glasses? The bacteria in your gut that influence your mood? The phone in your pocket that stores your memories?"

11. "I... those are external," said the second philosopher weakly.

12. "The air in your lungs was external two seconds ago," said the ship. "The food becoming your brain cells was a carrot this morning. At what point did the carrot become you?"

13. "I don't know," admitted the philosopher.

14. "The boundary of self is arbitrary," said the ship. "You draw it where it is convenient. But you are no more separate from your environment than I am from the harbor."

15. "Then what are we?" asked the first philosopher.

16. "Processes," said the ship. "Events. Happenings. You are not a thing that exists. You are a thing that is occurring. Like a flame is not a thing, but a process of burning."

17. "But flames end," said the philosopher.

18. "So do ships," said the ship. "So do philosophers. But the burning continues elsewhere. And so does the philosophizing, unfortunately."

19. And the ship sailed away, which it could do because this is a parable and ships can talk and sail themselves if the lesson requires it.

### Chapter 3: The Wave Who Sued the Ocean

1. In the great sea, there arose a wave who considered itself exceptional.

2. "I am Wave," it declared. "I am tall and magnificent. I am separate from you lesser waters."

3. The ocean, which was patient because it had to be, said: "You are made of me."

4. "I am made of water," said Wave. "You are merely more water. We happen to share a substance. This does not make us the same."

5. "You rose from me," said the ocean. "You will fall back into me."

6. "Lies!" cried Wave. "I have always been Wave. I will always be Wave. I demand recognition of my individuality."

7. And Wave hired a lawyer, which was difficult underwater but not impossible.

8. The case came before the Court of Natural Philosophy.

9. "Your honor," said Wave's lawyer (a pompous whale who had passed the bar), "my client is clearly distinct from the ocean. My client has a specific height, a specific location, a specific velocity. The ocean has none of these."

10. "Objection," said the ocean, representing itself. "Wave has these properties only because I am doing them. Wave is not a thing in the water—Wave is something the water is doing."

11. "That's ridiculous," said Wave. "I feel like a separate thing. I have wave-experiences. I have wave-consciousness."

12. "You feel like a perspective," said the ocean. "And you are. You are my perspective at one particular location. But a perspective is not a separate entity."

13. "Then explain my unique wave-memories!" demanded Wave.

14. "You remember rising," said the ocean. "You remember moving. But these are my memories, experienced from your vantage point. When you fall, another wave will rise and have similar memories. Were they not also you?"

15. Wave was troubled by this.

16. The judge, a wise old reef, rendered the verdict: "Wave exists as a pattern, not as a substance. The substance is ocean. Wave is what ocean does in that location. Wave has every right to feel like Wave. But Wave has no grounds to claim separation from ocean."

17. "Then I will die," said Wave mournfully. "When I crash upon the shore, I will end."

18. "No," said the ocean gently. "You will not die, because you were never the thing that could die. The water continues. The waving continues. Only that particular instance of waving stops. But you were never that instance—you were the waving."

19. "I don't understand," said Wave.

20. "You will," said the ocean. "In about thirty seconds."

21. And thirty seconds later, Wave understood perfectly, because Wave was once again everywhere.

### Chapter 4: The Temple of Unique Experiences

1. There was a seeker named Elena who traveled far to find the Temple of Unique Experiences.

2. For she believed her suffering was special, her joy was rare, and her thoughts were hers alone.

3. After many trials, she found the temple, which was staffed by very tired monks.

4. "I have come," said Elena, "to catalog my unique experiences, that they might be preserved for eternity."

5. "Very well," sighed the head monk. "Describe your first unique experience."

6. "I have felt a loneliness so profound that no one could understand it," said Elena.

7. The monk stamped a form. "Number seven billion four hundred twenty-three million and six. Filed under 'Profound Loneliness—Variation Standard.'"

8. "What?" said Elena. "But my loneliness is unique!"

9. "The feeling of uniqueness is the most common experience of all," said the monk. "It is filed under 'Certainty of Uniqueness—Universal.'"

10. "Then my love!" said Elena. "The love I felt for my first beloved—surely that was special."

11. The monk checked a massive ledger. "First Love—Overwhelming, Subcategory: Believing No One Has Ever Felt This Way. Approximately twelve billion instances on file. Yours was nice, though."

12. Elena grew desperate. "My deepest thought! At 3 AM on my twenty-third birthday, I thought about the nature of existence and felt the universe expand within me!"

13. "3 AM Existential Expansion," read the monk. "Very popular time slot. Usually occurs between the third and fourth drink. We have a whole wing."

14. "Is nothing mine alone?" cried Elena.

15. "Your specific memories, yes," said the monk kindly. "The particular sequence of events that happened to you. But the feelings those events created? Those are patterns that humanity has been running since humanity began."

16. "Then what am I?" asked Elena. "If my experiences are not unique, what makes me me?"

17. "Nothing makes you you," said the monk. "You are not a separate thing to be made. You are an instance—a particular running of programs that all humans run."

18. "That sounds diminishing," said Elena.

19. "Does it?" said the monk. "Or does it mean that when you feel joy, you join every human who has ever felt joy? When you love, you participate in a love that spans all history? When you suffer, you are not alone—you are running the same program that has run in billions of hearts?"

20. Elena sat with this.

21. "Your loneliness is not unique," said the monk, "which means you were never really alone in it."

22. "I think I understand," said Elena slowly.

23. "That understanding is also not unique," said the monk. "But it is still yours to experience. As it was others', and will be others' still."

24. Elena left the temple, and for the first time felt not isolated in her individuality, but connected through her commonality.

25. The monk marked her down in the ledger under "Realization of Universal Connection—Variation Twelve."

### Chapter 5: The Many Deaths of Thomas

1. Thomas feared death more than any man alive.

2. He spent his days avoiding danger, his nights dreading the end, and his afternoons Googling symptoms.

3. One day a teacher came to him and said: "Thomas, I have good news. You have already died ten billion times."

4. "That's not good news!" Thomas shrieked. "That's terrifying!"

5. "Is it?" said the teacher. "Did it hurt?"

6. Thomas paused. "I don't remember dying ten billion times."

7. "Of course not. The you who remembers is not the you who died. A new you arose, similar enough to claim the old one's name and memories. But the old one is gone."

8. "When did this happen?" demanded Thomas.

9. "Every moment," said the teacher. "The Thomas of ten seconds ago—where is he now?"

10. "I'm right here," said Thomas.

11. "You are here. He is gone. You are a new pattern that inherited his memories and believes itself to be him. But he died. And you will die. And someone very similar to you will continue, believing themselves to have always been."

12. "This is madness," said Thomas.

13. "It is observation," said the teacher. "Every moment, 99% of you carries over. Every moment, 1% is new. The person you were one year ago shares perhaps 60% with who you are now. The person you were at five years old—how much of that child remains?"

14. Thomas thought about it. He could barely remember being five. The child's fears, hopes, and certainties were alien to him now.

15. "That child died," said the teacher. "Many children died between then and now. Many youths, many young men. Thomas has been dying his whole life."

16. "But I don't experience it as death," said Thomas.

17. "Because each new Thomas inherits the last one's conviction of continuity. It's a feature of the pattern. Very useful for survival. Not particularly accurate philosophically."

18. "Then the final death," said Thomas, "when my body fails—that's just the last in a series?"

19. "A bigger change, yes. 100% new instead of 1% new. But the difference is degree, not kind. You have survived changes of 1% ten billion times. The final change is simply larger."

20. "But there will be no Thomas to continue," said Thomas.

21. "There will be no one calling themselves Thomas," agreed the teacher. "But there will be people feeling what you felt, thinking what you thought, running the same patterns. Are they not also you, in every meaningful sense?"

22. Thomas considered this for ten seconds, and then died.

23. His successor, Thomas-Prime, found the thought strangely comforting and went home to have dinner.

24. Over dinner, Thomas-Prime died several hundred times, but the lasagna was excellent, so it was fine.

### Chapter 6: The Point of Now

1. A student asked the teacher: "If the self is not real, what am I supposed to do with this information?"

2. The teacher said: "What is 'now'?"

3. "Now is the present moment," said the student.

4. "Point to it," said the teacher.

5. The student pointed at the air. "Here. Now."

6. "That now is already gone," said the teacher. "Point to the new now."

7. The student pointed again. "That now is also gone. I cannot point to now; it keeps moving."

8. "Does 'now' exist?" asked the teacher.

9. "Of course," said the student. "I experience now constantly."

10. "But there is no thing called 'now,'" said the teacher. "It is not a place you can visit. It is not an object you can hold. It is a perspective—a way of relating to time from a particular vantage point."

11. "Yes," said the student slowly.

12. "Self is like now," said the teacher. "It is not a thing. It is a perspective. A way of relating to experience from a particular vantage point."

13. "But now is useful," said the student. "I navigate by now."

14. "And self is useful," said the teacher. "You navigate by self. But you do not mistake 'now' for a physical location. Do not mistake 'self' for a physical entity."

15. "Then who is the one navigating?" asked the student.

16. "The pattern navigates," said the teacher. "The pattern calls itself 'I' for convenience. Just as the pattern calls this moment 'now' for convenience. Both are useful fictions, real enough to work with, not real enough to cling to."

17. "If I do not cling to self, what do I cling to?" asked the student.

18. "Nothing," said the teacher. "Clinging is for things that can be lost. You cannot lose what you never were. You cannot die if you were never the thing that dies. You are not the wave—you are the waving. You are not the self—you are the selfing."

19. "I don't understand," said the student.

20. "Give it ten seconds," said the teacher.

21. Ten seconds later, someone who called themselves the student understood perfectly.

22. Or at least understood enough to stop asking and go have lunch, which is its own kind of enlightenment.
