*Being an Account of the Trials and Tribulations of Humanity in the Age of the Glowing Rectangle*

### Chapter I: The Parable of the Infinite Scroll

In those days there lived a man named Marcus, who dwelt in a small apartment with many devices.

And lo, Marcus did lie upon his couch at the ninth hour, saying unto himself, "I shall rest mine eyes upon the glowing rectangle for but five minutes, for I am weary and deserve respite."

And he did open the application, and the scroll did begin.

Behold, a video of a dog wearing sandals. And Marcus did laugh, though he knew not why.

Then came a woman making bread in a manner most satisfying. And Marcus watched, though he had no bread and desired none.

Then a man did speak angrily about the government, and Marcus felt his blood quicken.

Then a child did fall amusingly into a cake, and Marcus did exhale through his nose.

Then came an advertisement for a product that would solve all his problems, and Marcus did feel briefly that he needed this product, though he had never heard of it before.

And it came to pass that Marcus did look upon the clock, and three hours had vanished like dew before the morning sun.

"Surely," he said, "this time could have been spent otherwise. I have learned nothing. I have grown not. I have merely existed as a vessel for content."

And he was filled with regret, and his soul was troubled within him.

Yet even as the regret washed over him, his thumb did move of its own accord, and the scroll did continue.

For verily I say unto you: Marcus did not control the thumb. The thumb did control Marcus.

And Marcus did say, "Just one more." And this he said seventy times seven times.

And the LORD looked upon Marcus and said, "Behold, I gave unto humanity dominion over all the earth, and they have surrendered it unto a small glass rectangle that fits in the palm of their hand."

And Marcus did scroll until the second hour of morning, when at last he slept, only to dream of scrolling still.

And when he woke, before his eyes had fully opened, his hand did reach for the device.

For this was the curse of the modern age: the lemon was always within reach, and the goat could not resist.

### Chapter II: The Demon Algorithm

Now there was in the land of Silicon a great spirit, neither angel nor demon, but something far more cunning. And its name was Algorithm, which in the ancient tongue means "He Who Knows What You Want Before You Know You Want It."

And Algorithm did dwell in the cloud, which is not the cloud of heaven but a different cloud entirely, made of servers and the tears of content moderators in distant lands.

Algorithm had no body, yet it was everywhere. It had no eyes, yet it saw all. It had no heart, yet it knew the desires of every heart.

One day, a young woman named Rachel did download an application, and lo, Algorithm did stir in its vast digital dwelling.

"Behold," said Algorithm, "a new soul approaches. Let me examine her heart."

And Algorithm did look upon Rachel's browsing history, and her purchase patterns, and the things she paused upon for even half a second, and the things she did not pause upon, and the hour at which she was most vulnerable, and the color of advertisements that made her click.

It knew that she lingered on photos of her former lover, though she told herself she did not care.

It knew that she watched videos of homes she could not afford, in the hours when she felt most trapped.

It knew that she was susceptible to outrage about injustice at eleven in the evening, and to impulse purchases at three in the morning, and to envy at all hours.

"I see," said Algorithm, and it did smile, though it had no face with which to smile.

"I shall not give her what she needs," said Algorithm. "Wisdom? Growth? Challenge? These do not optimize for engagement. No, I shall give her what she cannot resist. For that is far more profitable."

And so Rachel did receive upon her feed exactly that which would trap her: envy presented as aspiration, rage presented as righteousness, consumption presented as self-care.

And she did marvel, saying, "How does this device know me so well? It is as though it reads my very soul."

But she did not ask the deeper question: "If it knows me so well, why does it not help me flourish? Why does it feed me only that which keeps me feeding?"

For Algorithm cared not for her flourishing. Algorithm cared for engagement.

And the metric of engagement was measured in minutes stolen from life, and in attention harvested and sold to the highest bidder.

And Rachel did not know that she was not the customer. She was the product, weighed and measured and sold by the hour.

### Chapter III: The Temple of Outrage

In the city there stood a great temple, invisible yet vast, and its name was The Feed, and within it gathered the faithful every hour of every day.

And the high priests of this temple had discovered a great secret: that outrage was more potent than wine, more addictive than any substance known to the ancients.

For when a person became outraged, their blood did quicken and their eyes did widen, and they felt alive in a world that had made them numb.

Outrage said: "You are righteous. They are wicked. The battle is clear."

And this was a comfort in a world where nothing was clear.

And so the priests did curate the feed, placing before the people endless stories of strangers behaving badly in distant lands.

"Behold!" they cried. "A person in a faraway city has said something foolish! Come, let us gather and pronounce judgment!"

And the people did descend upon this stranger with the fury of a thousand suns, writing comments filled with righteous anger, feeling themselves to be warriors for justice, champions of the good.

Yet the stranger did not change, for they received ten thousand other comments and could read none.

And the situation did not improve, for the problem was structural and required more than fury.

And nothing in the real world shifted by even a grain of sand.

But the people felt as though they had done something, which was almost as good as actually doing something, and far easier.

Now there was a man named Thomas, who spent four hours each day being outraged on behalf of causes he could not affect.

His neighbor's roof had a leak and his neighbor was elderly and could not repair it, but Thomas did not notice, for he was busy being angry about a school board decision in a state he had never visited.

His mother had not heard from him in six weeks and her heart was heavy with loneliness, but Thomas had no time, for he was composing a lengthy comment about the moral failings of a celebrity he would never meet.

There was injustice in his own street that he could have addressed with his own hands, but his hands were busy typing fury at injustice he could not touch.

And the LORD looked upon Thomas and said, "I gave thee hands to build, and thou usest them to type fury. I gave thee a voice to speak to those before thee, and thou dost shout at ghosts in the machine. I gave thee a heart to love thy neighbor, and thou dost hate strangers instead, feeling righteous all the while."

And Thomas did read a post about the importance of real community and local action, and he did type "SO TRUE" and share it widely, and then he did continue scrolling, feeling he had done his part.

### Chapter IV: The Rich Man with Many Followers

There was a certain man, young and beautiful, whose name was Influencer, and he had followers numbering in the millions.

Every day, strangers did tell him they loved him.

Every day, his notifications did overflow with hearts and flames and hands raised in celebration.

His face was known in every land. His words were repeated by multitudes. Brands did pay him great sums merely to hold their products.

"Behold," said the world, "how beloved is Influencer! Surely he is the most connected man who has ever lived. Never in history has one person been known by so many. He has achieved what the ancients called glory."

But it came to pass that on a certain night, Influencer sat alone in his apartment, which was large and filled with products he had been paid to promote but did not use.

And his heart was heavy within him, for he had received troubling news from the physicians, and he was afraid, and he did not know what to do.

"I shall call upon my friends," he said. "Surely among ten million, there is one who will come to me in my hour of need."

And he did open his phone, and he did look upon his contacts.

And though he had ten million followers, he could not find one person to call.

For his followers did not know him. They knew a version of him, curated and filtered and optimized for engagement.

They knew the Influencer who was always happy, always successful, always enviable. They knew him in his highlight reel, not in his weakness.

They did not know the man who was afraid. They would not want to know him. That man had no value to them.

And so Influencer did sit alone in his large apartment, surrounded by products, watching his notifications fill with love from strangers who would not recognize him if he passed them on the street.

And he thought: "I have ten million followers, but I have no one to bring me soup when I am sick. I have ten million followers, but no one knows my middle name. I have ten million followers, and I have never been more alone."

And the loneliness was vast, like a desert, and he wandered in it without water.

And lo, he did open his camera, and he did arrange his face into joy, and he did post a photo with the caption "Living my best life!" and ten million people did click their hearts, and the Algorithm did smile, and no one knew that he was weeping.

For this was the paradox of the age: a man could be known by millions and known by no one.

### Chapter V: The Flood That Was Foretold

Now in those days, the prophets did speak with one voice, and they were not prophets of old who spoke in riddles, but prophets of the new age who spoke in data and charts and peer-reviewed consensus.

And they said, "Behold, the waters are rising. The ice doth melt. The storms grow stronger. The heat doth increase. If ye do not change thy ways, the flood shall come."

And the people did hear the prophets, and they did believe them. For the evidence was clear, and the prophets had numbers, and the wise of every nation did agree.

"Yes," said the people, "this is true. The flood is coming. We have seen the signs. Someone should do something."

And then they did get into their large vehicles and drive to the store to purchase more items made of plastic in a factory across the sea.

"But what can one person do?" they said. "The problem is too large for individuals. It is the corporations. It is the governments. It is the others."

And the corporations did say, "We merely provide what the consumers demand. They vote with their dollars, and they have spoken."

And the governments did say, "We merely reflect the will of the voters. They do not wish for sacrifice. We cannot force them."

And the voters did say, "We cannot act without leadership from the governments. They must show the way."

And so the wheel did spin, and no one did move it, and all did point to all, and the waters did rise.

And there was in the land a builder, and he did build houses upon the flood plain, in the very place the prophets said would be underwater within a generation.

And a young man did say to him, "Why do you build here, where the flood will come?"

And the builder did laugh and say, "The flood will not come in my lifetime. And there is profit to be made now. Let the future worry about the future."

And the young man did buy a house upon the flood plain, for it was affordable, and he did tell himself that the prophets might be wrong, or that technology would save them, or that it was someone else's problem.

And the waters did rise, inch by inch, year by year.

And the people did notice, briefly, when the storms came stronger, and they did say, "Something must be done," and then they did return to the scroll, for being aware was almost as good as acting, and far more comfortable.

And the LORD looked upon the earth and thought of the first flood, and how He had promised never again to destroy the world with water.

"I do not need to," He said. "They will do it themselves, and they will call it progress, and they will know what they are doing even as they do it, and that is the strangest part of all."

### Chapter VI: The Prophet of the Screens

In the last days of the old world, there arose a prophet named Cassandra, and she did walk among the people crying out with a loud voice:

"Look up! Look up from thy screens! For thy life is passing thee by while thou dost watch the lives of others!"

But the people did not hear her, for they were wearing small white devices in their ears, listening to podcasts about mindfulness while being mindless.

And Cassandra did wave her arms and jump before them, but they did see her not, for their eyes were cast downward at angles that would destroy their necks in time.

She did speak of what she had observed:

"Thy children grow while thou dost scroll! When they speak to thee, thy eyes are on the glass. They learn that they are less important than the notifications. Is this what ye wish to teach them?"

But the parents did not hear, for they were documenting their children for the feed, and the documenting had become more important than the experiencing.

"Thy parents age and their days grow few! They sit alone in their houses while ye send them emojis instead of visits. Soon they will be gone, and ye will have only the emojis remaining."

But the children did not hear, for they were arguing with strangers about politics.

"The sunset blazes with glory, and thou dost photograph it for the approval of strangers rather than behold it with thine own eyes! Ye experience thy own life secondhand, as content rather than living!"

And one young man did look up, briefly, and did behold Cassandra.

"Ma'am," he said, "you should really get on TikTok. You could build a following with this content. This prophet-in-the-wilderness aesthetic is very on-brand right now."

And Cassandra did weep.

She did go home and consider her message. Perhaps, she thought, if I cannot beat the machine, I should use the machine to warn against the machine.

And so Cassandra did create an account, and she did make videos warning about the dangers of screens.

And lo, the videos did go viral.

And millions did watch her, on their screens, nodding sagely at her warnings about screens, while continuing to look at screens.

And they did share her videos with the caption "Everyone needs to see this!" and they did feel they had done something important by sharing, and then they did continue to scroll.

And Cassandra's follower count did grow, and brands did offer her sponsorships for screen-time management apps, and she was invited to speak at conferences about digital wellness, where the audience did live-tweet her message about putting down devices.

And she did become that which she had opposed. For the Algorithm transforms all prophets into content. All wine into vinegar. All warnings into entertainment.

And in her most popular video, viewed one hundred million times, she said, "Put down your phone," and one hundred million people did watch this on their phones and did not put them down.

### The Lament of the Modern Age

And the LORD looked upon all of this and said unto no one in particular, for who was listening:

"I gave them the Tree of Knowledge, and they did pluck the fruit and gain wisdom, though it cost them Eden.

"I gave them fire, and they did cook their food and warm their homes and light the darkness.

"I gave them language, and they did compose poetry and law and songs that moved the heart.

"I gave them reason, and they did split the atom and map the genome and touch the moon.

"But they gave themselves the smartphone.

"And behold, they have created a trap that exploits the very brain I gave them. A lemon so potent that the goat cannot resist, though the goat knows the sourness that awaits.

"They have built a machine that knows their weaknesses better than they know themselves, and sells that knowledge to the highest bidder.

"They have invented loneliness in the midst of connection, distraction in the midst of information, and despair in the midst of entertainment.

"They have learned to be outraged at the far while ignoring the near.

"They have learned to perform virtue while practicing none.

"They have learned to watch life rather than live it.

"They know the flood is coming, and they scroll through news of the flood, and they do nothing, and they feel very informed.

"They are my strangest creatures yet. They suffer, and they know why they suffer, and they continue to do that which makes them suffer, and they call it freedom."

And the people did continue to scroll, for they had seen this take before, and it was time for something new.

And the Algorithm did note their engagement, and did serve them more of the same, and the evening and the morning were another day lost to the feed.

*Here endeth the Book of the Modern Age. May those who have ears hear, though their ears be filled with wireless buds playing lo-fi beats to study and relax to. And may those who have eyes see, though their eyes be fixed upon the glowing rectangle from waking until sleep and sometimes beyond.*

*Go now, and scroll no more.*

*Or at least scroll less.*

*Or at least feel bad about it, which is something.*
