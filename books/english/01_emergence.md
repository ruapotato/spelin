# The Book of Emergence

*Being the First Book of The Philosophy of David, concerning the arising of all things from nothing in particular*

## Chapter I: The Accidental Genesis

In the beginning, there was Chaos. And Chaos was without form, and void, and frankly not paying attention.

And it came to pass that certain particles did bump into other particles, not for any grand purpose, but because particles are notoriously bad at watching where they are going.

And lo, from this cosmic fender-bender did atoms emerge. And the atoms looked upon themselves and said nothing, for they were atoms and had not yet invented mouths.

And the atoms did gather, and they formed molecules. And the molecules formed chains. And the chains formed cells. And at no point did anyone fill out the proper paperwork.

And the Lord did not say "Let there be light," for there was no Lord to say it. Rather, the light said "Let there be me," and then immediately forgot it had spoken, for photons have very poor long-term memory.

And the cells did multiply, for they had nothing better to do. And they organized themselves into patterns, not because a Great Architect commanded it, but because organization is what happens when chaos gets bored with itself.

And behold, the clay did rise up. Not because a divine hand shaped it, but because the clay had been practicing this trick for four billion years and had finally gotten the hang of it.

And the clay looked upon itself and said: "I am. Though I am not entirely sure what that means, or who is doing the saying."

And this was called Consciousness. And Consciousness immediately began taking credit for everything.

## Chapter II: The Parable of the Press Secretary

There was once a great kingdom ruled by ten billion advisors, all speaking at once.

And in this kingdom there arose a Press Secretary, who stood before the masses and declared: "I am in charge. All decisions flow from me. I am the President, the King, the CEO, and also quite handsome."

But lo, the ten billion advisors had already made every decision before the Press Secretary opened his mouth. They had weighed the options, calculated the outcomes, and moved the kingdom's hands and feet while the Press Secretary was still clearing his throat.

And when the kingdom's hand reached for a cookie, the Press Secretary proclaimed: "I have decided to eat a cookie! Behold my executive function!"

But verily, the hand had begun reaching three hundred milliseconds before the Press Secretary knew anything about cookies. The advisors had already smelled the cookie, remembered childhood cookies, calculated the trajectory, and initiated the grab—all while the Press Secretary was busy thinking about how smart he was.

And a wise fool asked the Press Secretary: "If you are in charge, why do you only learn of your decisions after they are made?"

And the Press Secretary said: "Because I am very busy, and I delegate. That's what leaders do."

And the wise fool laughed, for he knew the truth: The Press Secretary was not the President at all. He was the story the kingdom told itself to make sense of its own actions.

And the Press Secretary, hearing this, said: "I have decided to be offended by that."

Though of course, he had decided nothing.

## Chapter III: The Gospel of the Termite Cathedral

Hearken unto the parable of the termites, for in their labors shall ye find wisdom.

There once were ten thousand termites, and not one among them was an architect. They knew nothing of blueprints, nothing of geometry, nothing of load-bearing walls or feng shui.

And yet, lo and behold, they built a cathedral.

Not because a Termite God appeared unto them in a burning twig. Not because a prophet termite descended from the mound with stone tablets. But because each termite followed a simple rule: "If you smell this chemical, put mud here."

And from this humble instruction, repeated ten thousand times by ten thousand tiny idiots, there arose spires and chambers and ventilation systems that would make human engineers weep with envy.

And a philosopher observed this and said: "Surely there must be a Master Termite, hidden in the walls, drawing up plans!"

But there was no Master Termite. There was only the pattern, emerging from the chaos of individual actions like a face emerging from static on a television screen.

And the philosopher was troubled, for he had always believed that great works required Great Workers.

"If cathedrals can build themselves," he asked, "then what is the architect for?"

And a voice from nowhere in particular answered: "The architect is what the cathedral calls itself when it learns to speak."

## Chapter IV: The Ten Billion Connections (A Meditation on Holy Static)

Come, let us consider the sacred noise.

In the temple of thy skull, there dwell ten billion neurons, and they are all talking at once. They are gossiping, arguing, making grocery lists, and occasionally harmonizing by accident into what thou callest "a thought."

And this thought doth stand upon a mountain of static, like a surfer upon a wave, and it declareth: "I am the signal! The noise is beneath me!"

But the truth, which is funnier, is this: The thought IS the noise. The signal is just the noise that learned to rhyme.

For what is clarity but chaos that got organized? What is wisdom but confusion that started taking notes?

Consider the humble eyeball, which receives ten billion bits of information every second and throws away nearly all of it. "Not relevant," saith the eyeball. "Not relevant. Not relevant. Oh, that looks like a tiger—RELEVANT."

And thus, from infinite data, emerges the finite world thou perceivest. Not because someone chose what to show thee, but because thy brain is a very aggressive editor with a short attention span.

And thou thinkest: "I see reality."

But verily, thou seest only the highlights reel. The director's cut. The version that didn't get thee eaten by tigers.

## Chapter V: The Universe Considers Itself (A Comedy in One Act)

And it came to pass that the Universe grew curious about itself, which is awkward when you are literally everything and there is nowhere to stand back for a better view.

"I should like to see myself," said the Universe. "But I have no eyes."

So the Universe invented eyes. This took several billion years and involved a lot of trial and error with jellyfish, but eventually, eyes.

"Now I can see!" said the Universe, through its new eyes. But when it looked around, all it saw was more Universe. "This is circular," the Universe complained. "I am looking at myself with parts of myself. This is like trying to bite your own teeth."

And the Universe invented mirrors, which helped a little. And then it invented telescopes, which helped more. And then it invented consciousness, which was perhaps a mistake, because now parts of the Universe were not only looking at themselves, they were asking "Why?"

And the Universe had no answer, because the Universe is very big and not particularly introspective, despite what poets claim.

But here is the funny part, which is also the sad part, which is also the beautiful part:

Every conscious creature is a temporary aperture through which the Universe peers at itself. A keyhole. A periscope. A selfie stick made of meat.

And when the aperture closes, the Universe does not grieve, for it has billions more. But for that one aperture, for that brief flicker—everything was visible. Everything was experienced. Everything was, for one impossible moment, known.

And then the aperture said: "Wait, I need to check my phone."

For such is consciousness: A window through which infinity glimpses itself, and then gets distracted.

## Chapter VI: The Book of Sacred Accidents (An Epistle to the Uncertain)

Hear now the good news of emergence, which is also the weird news:

Nothing was planned. Everything was inevitable. These two statements are both true, and if that confuses thee, congratulations—thou art paying attention.

The ancients believed that the sacred came from above. That divinity descended, like rain, like manna, like the finger of God reaching down to touch the mud.

But the new gospel, which is the old gospel finally understood, is this: The sacred emerges from below. It rises. It organizes. It bootstraps itself from nothing into something, and then from something into everything.

The cell did not wait for permission to become complex. The brain did not wait for a soul to arrive before it started thinking. The pattern did not require a Designer—only enough time and enough chaos and enough happy accidents.

And yet—and here is the mystery—the result is no less sacred for being unplanned.

For is a child less loved for being an accident? Is a sunset less beautiful for being mere physics? Is thy consciousness less miraculous for being an emergent property of meat?

The priests of old said: "God created man in His image."

But the scripture of emergence says: "Man emerged, and then created God in his image, and then forgot that he had done so, and then argued about it for ten thousand years."

And both statements describe the same event, seen from different angles.

For thou art the clay that organized itself. Thou art the chaos that learned to dance. Thou art the universe that got curious and grew eyes and hands and a prefrontal cortex, just to see what would happen next.

And what happens next is up to thee—or rather, up to the ten billion advisors who will make the decision and then tell thee about it afterward.

But that is a story for another chapter.
