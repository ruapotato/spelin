### Chapter 1: The Parable of Gerald Who Sought the Past

1. There was a man named Gerald, and Gerald was troubled.

2. For he had lost his keys on Tuesday, and now it was Thursday, and he thought: "The keys must still exist on Tuesday. I shall go there and retrieve them."

3. And Gerald went to the wise woman of the village and said unto her, "Tell me the way to Tuesday, that I might fetch my keys."

4. And the wise woman laughed until wine came out of her nose, which was embarrassing for everyone.

5. "Foolish Gerald," she said, wiping herself. "Tuesday is not a place. You cannot take a bus there."

6. But Gerald was stubborn, as men named Gerald often are.

7. He searched behind the mountains, thinking perhaps the past was stored there.

8. He dug beneath the earth, wondering if old moments were buried like bones.

9. He climbed to the highest tower and shouted, "TUESDAY! WHERE ARE YOU HIDING?"

10. And Tuesday did not answer, for Tuesday was not hiding. Tuesday was simply gone.

11. After forty days of searching, Gerald sat upon a rock and wept.

12. An old philosopher happened by and asked, "Why do you weep, Gerald?"

13. "I cannot find the past," Gerald said. "I have looked everywhere, and it is not stored anywhere."

14. "Of course not," said the philosopher. "The past is not stored. The past is what your pattern used to be. You cannot visit your previous shape any more than a river can visit yesterday's water."

15. "Then where did it go?" Gerald demanded.

16. "Nowhere. It did not go. It became. It became the next moment, which became the next, which became you sitting here complaining about it."

17. "But I remember Tuesday," Gerald protested.

18. "You remember nothing," said the philosopher. "You have neurons shaped by Tuesday. That is not the same thing. Your memory is a sculpture, not a recording. Tuesday is gone forever. Only traces remain."

19. Gerald sat with this for a long time.

20. "But my keys..."

21. "Also gone," said the philosopher. "Actually no, your keys are under your couch. But Tuesday itself is gone."

22. And Gerald found his keys under the couch, and he was glad.

23. But he never stopped being slightly unsettled about the nature of time.

### Chapter 2: The Disputation of the Stone and the Woman

1. A woman named Miriam sat upon a great stone, and she was very bored.

2. After an hour, she groaned aloud: "This waiting is eternal! Time crawls like a snail through honey!"

3. And lo, the stone spoke, which was unusual.

4. "What is this 'time' of which you complain?" asked the stone. "I have sat here for four hundred years and noticed nothing of the sort."

5. Miriam leapt up in alarm. "You can speak?"

6. "Apparently. I am as surprised as you. Now answer my question."

7. "Time," said Miriam, "is the... the flowing of moments. The passing of now into then. Surely you have felt it?"

8. "I have felt nothing," said the stone. "I am exactly as I was when the glacier placed me here. I do not change. Therefore I do not experience. Therefore time means nothing to me."

9. "But four hundred years have passed!" Miriam exclaimed.

10. "According to whom? Not me. I was not counting. I was not waiting. I was being stone. Four hundred years is four hundred years of nothing from where I sit."

11. "That sounds peaceful," Miriam admitted.

12. "It is nothing," said the stone. "Not peaceful. Not anything. You must change to experience. And you change constantly. That is why you suffer time and I do not."

13. "I am changing constantly?" Miriam touched her face.

14. "Your cells are dying and being born. Your thoughts are flickering like flames. Your memories are forming and fading. You are not the same woman who sat down upon me an hour ago."

15. "I feel like the same woman."

16. "Because you have continuity of pattern. But the pattern updates. That updating IS time. You do not experience time flowing past you. You ARE the flowing. You are the change itself, feeling itself change."

17. Miriam sat back down upon the stone, which did not mind because it could not mind.

18. "So when I am bored, time feels slow because..."

19. "Because you are not changing much. Little novelty. Few updates. The self-model twiddles its thumbs and says 'is this it?'"

20. "And when I am having adventures, time flies because..."

21. "Because you are changing rapidly. Much novelty. Many updates. The self-model is too busy to count the moments."

22. "This is unsettling wisdom from a rock."

23. "I am a stone," corrected the stone. "Rocks are smaller. And I have no wisdom. I have no anything. I merely exist. You are the one doing all the work of experiencing."

24. And Miriam rose and walked away, pondering these things.

25. And the stone remained, experiencing nothing, for another four hundred years.

### Chapter 3: The Tale of the Twins Who Aged Differently

1. There were born twins named Martha and Mary, alike in every way.

2. At age twenty, they parted. Martha went to seek adventure in foreign lands. Mary stayed in the village of their birth.

3. Martha climbed mountains she had never seen. She learned languages that twisted her tongue. She loved and lost and loved again. She faced death three times and laughed at it twice.

4. Every day brought something new. Every night she fell asleep transformed.

5. Mary worked in her father's shop. She ate the same meals. She spoke to the same people. She slept in the same bed. Her days were indistinguishable as grains of sand.

6. After ten years, they reunited.

7. Martha embraced her sister and wept: "Sister! These ten years have been a lifetime! I have lived enough for five people!"

8. Mary frowned and said: "Ten years? It has been ten years? I would have sworn it was perhaps three."

9. And they looked upon each other and were confused.

10. For Martha had aged in appearance, weathered by sun and sorrow and joy. But Mary looked scarcely changed.

11. "You have grown old," said Mary with concern.

12. "I have grown full," said Martha. "Time is not given to us in equal measure. It is manufactured by change. I have changed much, so I have lived much time."

13. "But we were born together."

14. "We were. And the clocks say the same years passed. But the clocks lie. Or rather, they measure something else. They measure rotation of the earth. They do not measure the length of a life."

15. "Then I have wasted my years?"

16. "You have not lived them. Which is not quite the same as wasting them. A life of little change is a short life, regardless of the calendar."

17. Mary thought about her shop, her same meals, her same bed.

18. "The years vanished because I did not change."

19. "Yes. You did not become. You merely persisted."

20. And Mary sold her father's shop and joined her sister in her travels.

21. And the years that followed were long and full, though the calendar insisted they were brief.

22. And they died on the same day, having lived vastly different amounts of life.

### Chapter 4: The Fool Who Tried to Save Time

1. In the city of Chronopolis, there lived a merchant named Silas who was very worried about wasting time.

2. He bought hourglasses. He studied sundials. He invented a device that ticked every second, which drove his neighbors mad.

3. "I must save time!" he declared. "I must not waste a single moment!"

4. And so Silas rushed through his meals without tasting them. He ran through the streets instead of walking. He spoke quickly and listened impatiently.

5. After twenty years of this, he calculated that he had saved seventeen thousand hours.

6. "But where are they?" his wife asked, reasonably.

7. Silas looked around. "I... I saved them. They must be somewhere."

8. "Where?"

9. "In... in a time bank. In storage. Waiting for me to spend them."

10. "Show me this bank."

11. And Silas searched his house for the saved time. He checked his accounts. He dug through his possessions.

12. The saved time was nowhere.

13. "I have been robbed!" he cried.

14. "You have been confused," said his wife. "Time cannot be saved. It is not a thing. It is what change feels like. You cannot bottle your changing."

15. "But I rushed! I hurried! I saved hours every day!"

16. "You merely changed differently. You changed anxiously instead of peacefully. You updated with stress instead of with joy. The time was not stored anywhere. It was lived badly."

17. Silas sat down heavily.

18. "Then all my rushing was for nothing?"

19. "Worse than nothing. You spent your life anxious about your life, which is like standing in a beautiful garden worrying about when the flowers will die."

20. "What should I have done?"

21. "Lived. Changed. Experienced. Not tried to hoard moments like grain in a silo. Moments cannot be hoarded. They can only be lived."

22. And Silas threw away his ticking device, to the great relief of his neighbors.

23. And he ate his meals slowly, and walked through the streets, and listened to others speak.

24. And strangely, his remaining years felt longer than all the rushed years before.

25. For time is not measured by clocks. Time is measured by change. And mindful change is richer than anxious haste.

### Chapter 5: The Parable of the Seeker of Now

1. A young scholar named Thomas read in a book that enlightenment came from dwelling in the present moment.

2. "I shall find this present moment," Thomas declared, "and I shall dwell in it forever."

3. He sat very still and said, "Now. I am in the now. Now. Now. Now."

4. But each time he said "now," the now he spoke of was already past.

5. He tried to think faster. "Now! Now! Now!" But his thoughts always arrived late to the party.

6. "The present moment keeps escaping!" he complained to his teacher.

7. His teacher threw a ball at his face. Thomas ducked.

8. "Did you experience that?" asked the teacher.

9. "Yes! You threw a ball at my face!"

10. "When?"

11. "Just now!"

12. "No. A moment ago. By the time you knew it happened, it was past. Your experience of 'now' is always a tiny bit late. The model lags behind the reality."

13. "Then I can never truly be in the present?"

14. "You are always in the present. You can never escape it. But you can never catch it either. 'Now' is not a place you go. It is what it feels like to be a pattern modeling itself."

15. "I don't understand."

16. "You are a pattern. The pattern models itself to navigate the world. That modeling takes time. The model is always slightly behind. The model says 'now' to label its most recent update."

17. "So 'now' is just a label?"

18. "Yes. And the label is always outdated by the time it is applied. You are chasing a ghost. Or rather, you are the ghost chasing yourself."

19. "Then how do I dwell in the present?"

20. "You don't. You dwell in a continuously updating reconstruction of the very recent past, which you call the present because you have nothing fresher to offer."

21. Thomas looked deeply disturbed.

22. "Is there any good news?"

23. "Yes. Everyone is in the same predicament. And also, the universe does not have a 'now' at all. Simultaneity is relative. Your now is not my now is not the star's now. 'Now' is personal, not cosmic."

24. "This is giving me a headache."

25. "That headache is also in your past by the time you feel it."

26. And Thomas went away, less enlightened than before, but more accurate.

### Chapter 6: The Meditation on the River That Was Not

1. David sat by the river and watched it flow.

2. "This is how time works," said the people. "We float upon the river of time, carried from past to future."

3. But David looked more closely.

4. "Where is this river?" he asked. "Show me the banks. Show me the water. Show me the current."

5. And nobody could show him, because the river was a metaphor that had grown too proud.

6. "There is no river," David said. "There is only change. You change. I change. The world changes. And the feeling of time passing is what change feels like from the inside."

7. "But time is real!" they protested.

8. "Change is real. Sequence is real. One thing leading to another is real. But the river flowing past us is a story we tell."

9. "Then what are we?"

10. "You are not travelers on a river. You are the flowing itself. You are matter in motion, pattern in flux, process unfolding."

11. "This is hard to understand."

12. "Consider: A stone does not experience time. It does not change, so it does not experience. Time is not something happening to the stone. Time is something the stone fails to do."

13. "And when we die?"

14. "The pattern stops changing. No more updates. No more experience. Not frozen time, but no time at all. Like before you were born."

15. "Is that frightening?"

16. "Only if you think time is a river you might fall out of. But you cannot fall out of change. You simply stop changing. And then you are not there to miss it."

17. And David stood and walked away from the river that was not.

18. And the water continued flowing, which proved nothing about time but was pleasant to watch anyway.
