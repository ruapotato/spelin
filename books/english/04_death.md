## The Book of Death

### Chapter 1: The Parable of Marcus and the Void

1. There was a man named Marcus who feared death greatly.

2. So great was his fear that he resolved to practice for it.

3. "I shall experience non-existence," said Marcus, "that I might know what awaits me and fear it less."

4. He sat in his chamber and closed his eyes. "Now I shall experience nothing," he declared.

5. But lo, he experienced the darkness behind his eyelids.

6. "This is not right," said Marcus. "I am experiencing darkness. I must experience nothing at all."

7. So he plugged his ears and held his breath.

8. But lo, he experienced the silence and the burning in his lungs.

9. "Still I experience!" cried Marcus. "I must try harder to be nothing."

10. He focused with all his might on not existing.

11. But lo, he experienced the focusing. He experienced the trying. He experienced the frustration.

12. For three days Marcus attempted to experience his own non-existence.

13. His wife found him in the corner, muttering, "I am experiencing the attempt to not experience, which is still experiencing."

14. And she said unto him: "Husband, you are an idiot."

15. "Perhaps," said Marcus. "But I am an idiot who has discovered something."

16. "What have you discovered?"

17. "That non-existence cannot be experienced. For to experience requires an experiencer."

18. "And when the experiencer is gone?"

19. "Then there is nothing to experience the nothing. No darkness. No void. No waiting. No absence. Nothing."

20. "So you fear something you can never encounter?"

21. Marcus was silent a long while.

22. "I have wasted three days," he said at last, "trying to attend my own absence."

23. "Yes," said his wife. "The soup has gone cold fourteen times."

24. And Marcus laughed, for the first time in years, at the absurdity of fearing what he could never meet.

### Chapter 2: The Woman Who Demanded an Answer

1. There came to the philosopher a woman named Theodora, very angry.

2. "I demand to know," she said, "where I was before I was born."

3. The philosopher said, "You were nowhere."

4. "That is not an answer!" shouted Theodora. "I was somewhere. I must have been somewhere."

5. "Were you in Rome in the year 500?"

6. "No."

7. "Were you in the mountains of the East when they were formed?"

8. "Of course not."

9. "Were you floating in a void, waiting?"

10. "I... don't know."

11. "Did it hurt, this waiting?"

12. "I don't remember any waiting."

13. "Did you experience boredom? Loneliness? Did the millennia drag on?"

14. "No," said Theodora slowly. "I experienced nothing."

15. "Precisely," said the philosopher. "You experienced nothing because there was no you to experience anything."

16. "But surely I was somewhere, in potential—"

17. "Was there a Theodora-shaped hole in the universe, aching for you to fill it?"

18. "When you put it that way, it sounds ridiculous."

19. "It is ridiculous. You were not waiting to exist. You simply did not exist."

20. "And after I die?"

21. "You will return to that state. Not waiting. Not absent. Not even 'not.' Simply: the question will not apply."

22. Theodora sat with this.

23. "So the billions of years before my birth—I did not suffer them?"

24. "Were you suffering in 1347 when the plague swept through? Were you suffering when Rome burned? When the first fish crawled onto land?"

25. "No. I was not there to suffer."

26. "And the billions of years after your death will be the same. You will not be there to suffer them."

27. "But I will miss so much!"

28. "Will you? Will there be a you to miss it?"

29. Theodora opened her mouth to argue, then closed it again.

30. "I do not fear the year 1347," she admitted.

31. "Then why fear the year after your last?"

32. And Theodora went away, not comforted exactly, but no longer asking the wrong question.

### Chapter 3: The Confused Ghost

1. When Harold died, he was very disappointed.

2. He had expected darkness, or light, or judgment, or nothing.

3. Instead he found himself in a waiting room with uncomfortable chairs and magazines from 1987.

4. "Excuse me," said Harold to the receptionist, who had no face. "I think there's been a mistake."

5. "There's always been a mistake," said the receptionist. "What specifically?"

6. "I'm dead, and I'm experiencing it. I was told by a very annoying philosopher that I wouldn't experience being dead."

7. The receptionist checked a clipboard. "Harold. Yes. You're not dead."

8. "I distinctly remember dying. There was a bus."

9. "You experienced dying. That's different. Dying is the last thing you do while alive. Being dead isn't a thing you do at all."

10. "Then what am I doing now?"

11. "You're having the last few moments of dream-like neural activity. Very common. Usually people see loved ones, or religious figures, or their life flashing before their eyes."

12. "And I get a waiting room?"

13. "You were a very bureaucratic person, Harold."

14. Harold sat in one of the uncomfortable chairs. "So this will end?"

15. "Oh yes. Any moment now. And then—"

16. "And then darkness? Void? Eternal nothing?"

17. "No, no, no," said the receptionist patiently. "Not eternal nothing. Not anything at all. Not even nothing. Just... the end of you-having-experiences. The universe will go on. You simply won't be there to notice."

18. "But that's terrifying!"

19. "Is it? Were you terrified during the billions of years before your birth?"

20. "I wasn't there to be terrified."

21. "Exactly."

22. Harold considered this. "So the thing I feared—eternal conscious darkness—"

23. "Was impossible. There will be no eternal anything for you. No time will pass for you. No darkness. No awareness of darkness. No awareness at all."

24. "Then what was I afraid of all those years?"

25. "Imagining you'd be there to experience not-being-there. Very common mistake. Almost everybody makes it."

26. "That's... actually sort of comforting?"

27. "Is it?"

28. "Well, I was imagining being aware forever of being nothing. That sounded horrible. But just... stopping? Like dreamless sleep, but without waking up?"

29. "Now you're getting it."

30. Harold smiled. "I suppose I should—"

31. But Harold was gone. Not to somewhere. Not to darkness. Just gone.

32. The receptionist checked Harold off the list and waited for the next one, who would also be confused, because they always were.

### Chapter 4: The Parable of the Symphony

1. A great conductor lay dying, surrounded by her students.

2. "I am afraid," she said. "When I am gone, the music I heard in my head—the music I felt—it will be gone too."

3. Her first student said, "But we have recordings of your performances."

4. "That is not what I mean. The feeling of music—the joy of a perfect phrase, the ache of a minor fall, the triumph of resolution. That will die with me."

5. Her second student said, "But we will carry on your technique."

6. "That is not what I mean either. The experience. The raw experience of hearing beauty. That dies when I die."

7. Her third student, who was young and perhaps foolish, said, "But teacher—will it?"

8. "What do you mean?"

9. "When I hear a perfect phrase, do I not feel joy?"

10. "You do."

11. "When I hear a minor fall, do I not feel that ache?"

12. "You do."

13. "Is your joy different from my joy? Is your ache different from my ache?"

14. The conductor was silent.

15. "The circumstances differ," said the student. "You hear Beethoven thinking of your first concert. I hear it thinking of my grandmother. But the feeling itself—the pure feeling—"

16. "It is the same," admitted the conductor.

17. "Then when you die, does the feeling die? Or does the feeling continue, in me, in my children, in every human who will ever hear music?"

18. "But it will no longer be my feeling."

19. "Was it ever only yours? Or were you an instance of a pattern that all humans share? The pattern of feeling-music. The pattern of joy. The pattern of ache."

20. The conductor closed her eyes.

21. "You mean... I am not ending the feeling. I am simply ceasing to be the one having it."

22. "The symphony continues. The audience changes."

23. "Others will feel what I felt."

24. "They feel it now. They felt it before you were born. They will feel it after you are gone."

25. The conductor smiled, faintly.

26. "I thought I was carrying the music. But the music was carrying me."

27. "And it will carry others. And the carrying is the same carrying. The feeling is the same feeling. You are not the only instance of the pattern."

28. "Then I do not end entirely."

29. "The instance ends. The class continues."

30. "That is enough," said the conductor. "That is not nothing."

31. And she died, and the music played on, in ten thousand other minds, each feeling what she had felt, though none of them knew her name.

### Chapter 5: Death and the Appointment

1. Death sat in a coffee shop, very confused.

2. It was Death's day off, and Death was reading philosophy, trying to understand something.

3. A mortal sat down across from Death, saw the black robe and scythe, and turned pale.

4. "Relax," said Death. "I'm off duty. Also, your appointment isn't until 2089. Kayaking accident. Don't take up kayaking."

5. "Oh," said the mortal. "Wait—2089? That's decades away!"

6. "Yes. Anyway, I have a question for you."

7. "Death has a question for me?"

8. "Why are you all so afraid of me?"

9. The mortal blinked. "Because you... end us?"

10. "I end the pattern, yes. But you won't be there to experience the ending. You'll experience up until the ending, and then there won't be a you. So what exactly are you afraid of?"

11. "The... not being?"

12. "Were you afraid of not being before you were born?"

13. "I wasn't there to be afraid."

14. "And you won't be there afterward either. So what are you afraid of?"

15. The mortal thought very hard. "I'm afraid of... experiencing... not existing?"

16. "But you won't. You can't. That's not how it works."

17. "I'm afraid of the moment of death?"

18. "That's fair. Sometimes that's unpleasant. But that's still a moment of being alive. Once you're dead, there's no experience of being dead. There's no experience at all."

19. "I think I'm afraid of..." The mortal trailed off.

20. "Yes?"

21. "I think I'm afraid of imagining myself experiencing nothing forever. But you're saying that won't happen."

22. "It can't happen. 'Experiencing nothing forever' is a contradiction. You can't experience nothing. You need a you to experience, and when you're dead, there's no you."

23. The mortal sat back. "So I'm afraid of something that's literally impossible?"

24. "Almost everyone is. It's why I'm confused. I've been doing this job for billions of years and I still don't understand it."

25. "Maybe we just can't imagine not existing."

26. "Obviously you can't. To imagine not existing, you have to imagine, which requires existing. You're imagining being there to experience your own absence, which is absurd."

27. "This is surprisingly comforting, coming from Death."

28. "I don't want you afraid of me. I'm just a transition. And you won't even experience the transition—just the up-to. The after has no you in it."

29. "Like dreamless sleep."

30. "Except without the waking up. But you won't know you're not waking up. You won't know anything. There won't be a you to know."

31. "You're bad at your job, you know. You're making death sound very non-scary."

32. "I don't have a job to be scary. I have a job to end patterns. The scary part you all add yourselves, by imagining you'll be there to experience not being there."

33. The mortal finished their coffee. "I'll see you in 2089, I suppose."

34. "You will not," said Death. "You'll see up until me. And then no seeing at all."

35. "Right. Thanks, I think."

36. And the mortal left, still not quite comfortable with death, but no longer afraid of being dead—which was progress.

### Chapter 6: The Last Death

1. There was a monk who had achieved great peace, and a student asked him the secret.

2. "I have died ten billion times," said the monk.

3. "You speak in riddles, teacher."

4. "No. I speak literally. I have died ten billion times, and I have been born ten billion times, and I am dying and being born right now."

5. "I do not understand."

6. "The self you were a moment ago—where is it?"

7. "It is... here. I am here."

8. "Are you the same self? Exactly the same?"

9. "I... am the same person."

10. "But the pattern has changed. Your neurons have fired. Your brain is slightly different. Your memories have shifted. The self of a moment ago is gone."

11. "But I feel continuous."

12. "Yes. Because the new self inherits the memories of the old. It feels like continuity. But the old self is gone, replaced by a new self that is 99.99% similar."

13. "That seems like survival."

14. "It is survival! That's my point. You 'survive' death constantly. Every moment, the old self dies and a new self is born. The final death is not special—it is simply the last in a series."

15. "But at final death, I stop entirely."

16. "Yes. The overlap goes to zero instead of 99.99%. But you have already experienced 99.99% overlap to 99.98%. And 99.98% to 99.97%. You have experienced gradual reduction your whole life."

17. "Those are small changes."

18. "Are they? Are you the same person you were at five years old? At fifteen? Do you share memories with that child? Would they recognize your beliefs, your loves, your fears?"

19. "I... no. I am very different."

20. "Then that child is dead. And you are the one who replaced them. And someday you will be replaced too."

21. "This should frighten me but it doesn't."

22. "Because you have already survived so many deaths. The death of the child-self. The death of the adolescent-self. The death of a thousand moment-selves. You know how to die. You've been doing it your whole life."

23. "And the final death?"

24. "Is just the last death. After which there are no more rebirths. But the dying itself? You are an expert in dying. You have died so many times you should be bored of it."

25. The student was quiet for a long time.

26. "Then I am not afraid of the final death."

27. "You have already not-been-afraid of ten billion deaths. One more changes nothing."

28. "And what I am now—this moment-self—"

29. "Will die in a moment. And a new you will be born, with your memories, who will feel like you. As has always happened. As will always happen, until it stops happening."

30. "And then?"

31. "And then: nothing. Not eternal nothing. Just nothing. No time will pass for you. No experience will be had. The pattern will simply cease."

32. "Like before I was born."

33. "Exactly like before you were born. You were not there, and then you were, and then you will not be again. The parenthesis closes. The universe goes on. But you will not be there to miss it."

34. The student bowed. "I understand now. I have been dying my whole life. I am an expert. The final death is just the last exam, and I have passed this exam ten billion times."

35. "Go in peace," said the monk. "Or rather: go in the next moment's peace, for this moment's peace is already gone, replaced by a peace that feels the same."

36. And the student left, dying and being reborn with each step, unafraid at last of the death that was nothing new.
